/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass /eight * h (height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

//const massMark = 95;
//const heightMark = 1.88;
//const massJohn = 85;
//const heightJohn = 1.76;

const BMIMark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
const BMIJohn = massJohn / heightJohn ** 2;
//const BMIJohn =  massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

console.log(BMIMark);
console.log(BMIJohn);

if (BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMIMark}) is higher than john's (${BMIJohn})!`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIJohn}) is higher than mark's (${BMIMark})!`);
}

let x = 2;
x = x ** 3;
console.log(x);
